# Console Snake Game

WIP simple snake console/text game.

## Details:
  Snake and tail are saved as a linked list.
  
  Only head, first tail and last "tail" are written to the screen, so it will not start to "lag" as the tail
  become long.  The last tail is writing a " ", so it erase the end of the snake. 
  
  UI/score are only written to screen when its changed.
  
  Keyboard input WASD/Arrowkeys and space to add to tail
  
  TODOO:
  
  Add food to increase length.  ATM the snake grows as one click space.
  Crash tests, walls and tail.
  Sound?
